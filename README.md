<h1>Text to Emoji Encryption and Decryption</h1>
<p>This project is designed to convert text into emojis for encryption and then convert those emojis back into text for decryption. It's a fun way to encode messages using emojis!</p>

How It Works
Encryption
Input Text: The user enters the text they want to encrypt.
Conversion to Emojis: Each character in the input text is replaced by a specific emoji according to a predefined mapping.
Encrypted Text: The resulting string is a sequence of emojis representing the original text.
Decryption
Encrypted Emojis: The sequence of emojis is provided as input.
Conversion to Text: Each emoji is converted back into its corresponding character based on the predefined mapping.
Decrypted Text: The resulting characters form the decrypted text, revealing the original message.
