<h1>Text to Emoji Encryption and Decryption</h1>
<p>This project is designed to convert text into emojis for encryption and then convert those emojis back into text for decryption. It's a fun way to encode messages using emojis!</p>

<h2>How It Works</h2>
<h3>Encryption</h3>
<b>Input Text:</b> The user enters the text they want to encrypt.
<b>Conversion to Emojis:</b> Each character in the input text is replaced by a specific emoji according to a predefined mapping.
<b>Encrypted Text:</b> The resulting string is a sequence of emojis representing the original text.

<b>Decrypted Text:</b> The resulting characters form the decrypted text, revealing the original message.
